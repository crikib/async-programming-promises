Promises represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

XMLHttpRequest = Request against an API
Open
onLoad
send

Axios is an abstraction on top of XMLHttpRequest

Promise can have three states - Pending, Fulfilled or Rejected

Need to consider Pending, Fulfilled and Rejected when making a promise.


Async/await is syntatic sugar for promises (meant to make working with promises easier)

Await is used insted of async and used for blocking current function

Return is wrapped in a promise

Async function
async function getNames(){
    return[];
}

const getNames = async() => {
    return [];
}
